### User Stories

- A potential employer would like to know more able myself and my work and education history, so they can go visit the ‘About Me’ section of my website to find all of the information that they require.

- A potential client would like to hire me for a job, however they would like to see what type of projects I have done before and am currently working on, so they can go to the ‘Projects’ section of my website to see the project that I have done to give them a better understanding of what I do.

- A potential client would like to get in contact with me to discuss details, so they are able to go to the ‘Contact’ section of my website where they will be able to contact me either via email, phone, GitHub or LinkedIn.

### Wireframes

See all images located in the directory named ‘Wireframes’.

## Features

    • Navigation – I used HTML & bootstrap to create a responsive navbar so that people can easy navigate no matter what device they are on.
      
    • Welcome Section – I used this section to welcome anyone who views my website to make it feel more personal.
      
    • About Section – Here I provided all of the information about me including a profile picture and a personal summary so that viewers can get to know me better.
      
    • Project Section – Here I have created a responsive grid showcasing all of the projects that I have done or contributed towards.
      
    • Skills Section – Here I have used bootstrap to create progress bars in which I use to represent my comfort level with the associated languages that I use on a day by day basis.
    
    • Contact Section – Here I have used fontawesome to represent ways in which viewers of my website can get in contact with me.
 
### Features Left to Implement

In the future as my skills increase I would like to include a gallery section of all of the pictures I have taken myself so that others my see. I would either have this as a carousel or as a grid system where they can click on each to enlarge the images.

As I add more projects I would also like to implement the option for the viewers to either view the projects either in a grid or in a carousel and they can cycle through all of the projects that I have done.

## Technologies Used

- [HTML](https://html.com/)
    - I used **HTML** for the structure of the website as it is the best and easiest language to do so.

- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp)
    - I used **CSS** to style the website as it is the convention when dealing with a website that does not have many features.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
    - I used **Bootstrap** for the responsiveness of the website as many websites use family libraries to help with the styling and responsiveness of websites.

- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com)
    - I used **FontAwesome** for all of my icons in my website.

- [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com)
    - I used **Google Fonts** to pick the fonts for my website. The fonts that I have chosen are Raleway and Playfair Display.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
